# 3D Geometry Dash Graphs

This is mainly an analysis of perspective distortion when showing a 3D image on a 2D screen. I'll use this to assist in creating a 3D Geometry Dash level.

## Usage

Render ring.blend in Blender (It's in 32K resolution, so it might take a while). Then, create a directory called `input` and put the rendered image in there. Then, run `analyze.py`. A few graphs should open.
